<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 lbs potatoes (4-5 potatoes)</li>
    <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    <li> tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>4-5 eggplant-bacon slices, chopped into bites, to serve</li>
    <li>1 cup diced tomato, to serve</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a crinkle cutter, cut the potatoes into slices; then cut them into individual fries.</li>
    <li>Place the fries in a large bowl and add the seasonings and oregano. Toss until evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Spread the fries on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 30 minutes, flipping halfway, until crispy. Alternatively, you can make these in an air fryer at 400°F/200°C for 20 to 25 minutes, tossing the potatoes every 5 minutes until crispy.
    </li>
    <li>While the potatoes are baking, make the sauce. Add 3 inches of water to a medium pot and insert a steaming basket. Add the diced potato and carrot, cover, and steam for 15 to 20 minutes until soft. Transfer to a blender or food processor together with the garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, turmeric, and lemon or lime juice. Blend until very smooth, adding a tiny bit of water if needed.</li>
