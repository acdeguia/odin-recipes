<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>CCreamy Broccoli Pasta is a pantry friendly recipe featuring a non-dairy cream sauce tossed with pasta and tender broccoli for a quick and easy vegan main dish ready in 30 minutes!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Brocolli</li>
    <li> Flour</li>
    <li>Nutritional Yeast</li>
    <li>Plant milk</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt+pepper</li>
    <li>Onion Powder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta + broccoli. I like to cook my broccoli with the pasta. Just be sure you’ve added enough water to the pot if you do this. To do this I suggest adding the broccoli to the cooking pasta 3 minutes before pasta is done. Broccoli is at its best when it turns its brightest green. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Make the creamy base. You’ll create your creamy sauce by making a roux with flour, oil and non-dairy milk. The roux takes about 8 – 10 minutes to cook so you can start this while the water for the pasta is coming to a boil. Once done, cover and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>Assemble. Add your cream base to the pasta and broccoli, mix and serve. Season with salt + pepper.</li>
